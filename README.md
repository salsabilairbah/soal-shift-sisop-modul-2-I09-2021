NUMBER 1
For number 1, i still can answer from a to d. but for e and f, i still confused and still figured it out. 
When i did the assignment, I got a little struggle about the output, i put while before if and the output 
only show musik.zip, musyik,fylm,pyoto, but only musyik contains the files and also not stop. so I try 
to put the while inside if and when I run it, the output turned out right. I use fork(), wait()
fork() use to make two process which run concurrently. the function of wait() is blocking the calling 
process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. stat greater than 0, 
so it is not null, so it stored stat information.
